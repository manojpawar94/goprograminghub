Guido van Rossum has created the Python in 1991 and was further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It is a general-purpose programming language used in various fields like,</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Web Development</li>\n      <li>Software Development</li>\n      <li>Game Development</li>\n      <li>AI &#x26; ML</li>\n      <li>Data Analytics</li>\n      <li>System Scripting</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development. It has extensive standard libraries that are freely available in form of source code or binaries for all the major platforms. Also, the Python interpreter is easily extensible with data types and functions implemented in C or C++.</p>\n    <h4>Real World Applications developed using Python</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Instagram</strong>: Instagram also uses python extensively. They have built a photo-sharing social platform using Django which is a web framework for python. Also, they can successfully upgrade their framework without any technical challenges.</li>\n      <li><strong>Netflix</strong>: There are various projects on Netflix which use python as follows:\n        <ul>\n          <li>Central Alert Gateway</li>\n          <li>Chaos Gorilla</li>\n          <li>Security Monkey</li>\n          <li>\n            Chronos\n            Amongst all projects, regional failover is the project they have as the system decreases outage time from 45 minutes to 7 minutes with no additional cost.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li><strong>NASA</strong> (<em>National Aeronautics and Space Agency</em>): One of Nasa’s Shuttle Support Contractors, the United Space Alliance developed a Workflow Automation System (WAS) which is fast. Internal Resources within critical project stated that:\n        <ul>\n          <li>“Python allows us to tackle the complexity of programs like the WAS without getting bogged down in the language”.</li>\n          <li>Nasa also published a website (https://code.nasa.gov/) where there are 400 open source projects which use python</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n","slug":"01-Introduction-to-Python"},"posts":[{"title":"Introduction to Python Language","excerpt":"Python is an easy to learn, powerful, object-oriented, high-level programming language.
