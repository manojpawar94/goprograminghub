Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.</p>\n    <h4>Go can be used for,</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Go can be used for a variety of software development purposes.</li>\n      <li>Cloud and network services</li>\n      <li>With a broad ecosystem of tools and APIs on major cloud providers, it is easier than ever to develop services using Go.</li>\n      <li>Command-line interfaces</li>\n      <li>With popular open-source packages and a robust standard library, use Go to create fast and elegant CLIs.</li>\n      <li>Web development</li>\n      <li>With enhanced memory management and support for several IDEs, Go power fast and scalable web applications.</li>\n      <li>DevOps and site reliability</li>\n      <li>With the least build time and lean syntax, an automatic formatter, and a doc generator, Go supports DevOps and SRE.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h4>Real-world products developed using Go.</h4>\n    <p>Below are the few popular products developed using Go.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Google developed Kubernetes</li>\n      <li>Docker, the world-famous containerization platform</li>\n      <li>Dropbox has migrated its performance-critical components from Python to Go</li>\n      <li>Netflix Application data caching using SSD's</li>\n      <li>Uber GPU-power analytics engine in Go</li>\n      <li>Wildlife studio builds backend system in Go</li>\n      <li>Infoblox's next-generation networking products</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h4>Go Installation</h4>\n    <p>It is easy to install the Go on your personal laptop/desktop in just a three-step process.</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        Download the Go installer file from the below URL,<br>\n        <a className=\"btn btn-primary btn-sm\" href=\"https://golang.org/doc/install\">Install Go</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>Double click on the downloaded installer will open an installation popup window and follow the instructions</li>\n      <li>Verify that you have installed the Go by opening a command prompt(CMD) and type the following command</li>\n    </ol>\n    <div class=\"remark-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">$<span class=\"token space\"> </span>go<span class=\"token space\"> </span>version<span class=\"token lf\"></span>\n<span class=\"token lf\"></span>go<span class=\"token space\"> </span>version<span class=\"token space\"> </span>go1.16.7<span class=\"token space\"> </span>darwin/amd64\n</code></pre>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n","slug":"01-Introduction-to-Go-Language"},"posts":[{"title":"Introduction to Go Language","excerpt":"Go is an open-source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software and makes programmers more productive.","createdAt":"2021-05-03","author":"manoj-pawar","permalink":"/posts/programming/golang/01-Introduction-to-Go-Language","slug":"01-Introduction-to-Go-Language"},{"title":"Hello World to Go Programming","excerpt":"Let's write first programming in Go Language to print hello world.","createdAt":"2021-05-03","author":"manoj-pawar","permalink":"/posts/programming/golang/02-Hello-World-to-Go-Language","slug":"02-Hello-World-to-Go-Language"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
